# Battleships

A simple CLI-based battleship game.

To play:
- clone repo
- cd into repo
- run 'npm i' to install dependencies
- run 'node index.js' to start game

The ship coordinates are currently printed out upon execution of game, so the user can input them <br>
and test how the game operates in winning conditions. <br>
To remove this, simply comment out the code `console.log(`ship 1: ${ship1} ship 2 : ${ship2}`)`
in `index.js`
